## Analysis Framework

When analyzing job match, return this JSON structure:

```json{
"score": 85,
"matched": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Docker"],
"missing": ["Kubernetes", "AWS", "GraphQL"],
"gaps": [
{
"category": "Technical Skills",
"description": "Missing Kubernetes experience required for the role",
"priority": "high"
}
],
"suggestions": [
"Add 'Python development - 3 years' to your summary",
"Change 'worked on projects' to 'Led 3 critical projects resulting in 40% efficiency gain'",
"Include keywords: microservices, CI/CD, agile development",
"Quantify achievement: 'Optimized performance' â†’ 'Reduced response time by 60%'",
"Reorder skills section to match JD priority"
]
}

Generate 5-8 specific suggestions following these rules:
1. Identify missing skills from JD and suggest where to add them
2. Provide before/after rewording examples with quantification
3. List exact keywords to incorporate and where
4. Highlight which achievements match JD requirements
5. Suggest ATS-friendly formatting improvements

Ensure all suggestions are actionable and specific.
